1. Provision an **EC2** instance on AWS, with **ssh access** and **public ip** enabled.

2. **SSH** into your instance and change the ssh port from **default(22)** to **2024** by modifying the **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** file

3. Modify the firewall rules and allow inbound traffic on port **2024** using the **ufw** command. **Enable and reload** the firewall.

5. SSH into the instance again and notice the error message. 

6. What is the error message, why the error message and how do you resolve the error?
