### The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with the Linux terminal by manipulating files using some common commands.


1. Cd to your desktop directory

2. Use the touch command to create an empty file called example.txt eg touch example.txt

3. Use the nano command to edit the contents of example.txt and  add the lines from the example.txt eg nano example.txt

4. Save and exit

5. What is the command to save and edit in nano?

6. Use a command to display the entire content of example.txt.

7. Use the echo command to add a new line to the end of the file with the text "Appended line for practice." eg. echo "Appended line for practice." >> example.txt

8. Use the sed command to replace the word "practice" with "manipulation" throughout the file. eg sed -i 's/practice/manipulation/g'

9. Use the cp command to make a copy of example.txt named example_backup.txt.

10. Use the sed command to remove the second line from example_backup.txt eg  sed -i '2d' example_backup.txt

11. Use the wc command to count the number of words in example.txt. eg wc -w example.txt

12. Use a command to count the number of words in backup_example.txt.

13. Exit your terminal

14. Go to your desktop in GUI and see if you can find the files exmple.txt and exampe_backup.txt.
