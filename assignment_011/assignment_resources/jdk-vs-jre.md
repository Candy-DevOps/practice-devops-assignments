### What Is The Difference Between JRE And JDK?

**The "JRE" in "OpenJDK-17.JRE" stands for "Java Runtime Environment." The JRE is a subset of the Java Development Kit (JDK), which contains tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications.**    

**The main difference between OpenJDK-17 and OpenJDK-17.JRE is that the former includes the full JDK, which includes development tools such as compilers and debuggers, while the latter includes only the Java runtime environment needed to run Java applications.**   

**So, if you're developing Java applications with maven for instance, you would typically use OpenJDK-17 rather than just the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), as it provides everything you need for development and execution. However, if you only need to run Java applications without needing to compile or debug them, you can use OpenJDK-17.JRE to save disk space and resources by not installing the development tools.**    

**The JDK includes the JRE but also provides additional tools and libraries necessary for compiling, debugging, and building Java applications.**
