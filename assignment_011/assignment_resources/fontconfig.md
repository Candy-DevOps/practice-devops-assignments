### WHhat Is FONTCONFIG And Why Do I Need It?

**Fontconfig is a library designed to provide system-wide configuration for font settings in Unix-like operating systems. It allows applications to access and configure fonts in a consistent manner, providing features such as font matching, font substitution, and font rendering customization.**   

**Java applications often require fontconfig because they rely on system fonts for text rendering. When running Java applications in environments where fontconfig is not installed, the applications may encounter issues related to font availability, font rendering, or font configuration.**   

**By installing fontconfig alongside Java, you ensure that Java applications have access to the system fonts and can render text correctly according to the system configuration. This helps maintain consistency in text rendering across different applications and environments.**    

**In simpler terms, Fontconfig is like a manager for fonts on your computer. It helps applications, like Java programs, find and use the right fonts when they need to display text.**   

**When you install fontconfig with Java, you're making sure that Java programs can access and use the fonts available on your system. This ensures that text in Java applications looks the way it's supposed to, without any weird or missing characters. So, it's kind of like making sure that all the text in your Java programs appears properly and is easy to read.**
